i had a client who contracted me to build them a professional appp here is exactly what they needed:


# **PRODUCT STRATEGY & DECISIONS**
## *Board-Level Product Design Document*

---

## **1. CORE USER TYPES & ACCOUNT STRUCTURE**

### **Decision: Three Account Types (Not Two)**

**Why:** You need a third category for the most valuable users.

1. **Founders** - People with ideas seeking feedback/cofounders/funding
2. **Builders** - Technical/business talent seeking projects to join
3. **Investors** - Angels, VCs, scouts looking for deals

**Reasoning:**
- "Founders" and "Cofounders" aren't the same
- Someone might want to join a startup but not lead one
- Builders provide critical feedback AND are potential team members
- This creates network effects: Founders ↔ Builders ↔ Investors

### **Sign-Up Flow Decision:**

**Step 1:** "What brings you here?"
- 🚀 I have an idea (Founder)
- 🛠️ I want to build something (Builder)  
- 💰 I invest in startups (Investor)
- 👀 Just browsing (Lurker - read-only initially)

**Step 2:** Verification (different for each)
- **Founders/Builders:** Email verification only (low friction)
- **Investors:** 
  - Email verification
  - LinkedIn connection OR
  - Proof of investment (Crunchbase profile, AngelList, past investments)
  - Manual approval for first 6 months (prevent fake investors)

**Decision: Investors MUST verify** to prevent:
- Founders wasting time on fake investors
- Data harvesting
- Competitors posing as investors
- Spam

---

## **2. CONTENT VISIBILITY & PRIVACY CONTROLS**

### **For Founders:**

**Decision: Three-Tier Visibility System**

When posting ANY content, founders choose:

**Tier 1: "Public"** 🌍
- Visible to everyone (founders, builders, investors, logged-out users)
- Appears in public feed
- Can be shared externally
- Indexed by search engines eventually

**Tier 2: "Community Only"** 👥
- Visible only to verified founders + builders
- NOT visible to investors
- Use case: Early-stage ideas, getting peer feedback before investor scrutiny
- Can upgrade to Public or Investors later

**Tier 3: "Investors Only"** 💼
- Visible only to verified investors
- Use case: Actively fundraising, don't want idea stolen by other founders
- Premium feature (paid) or unlocks after account age/engagement threshold

**Decision: Default visibility = "Public"**
- Maximizes engagement for new users
- Can always change later
- Warning shown: "This will be visible to everyone including investors and competitors"

### **Special Case: The Pinned Pitch**

**Rule: Your first pitch video defaults to "Public"**
- This is your profile anchor
- Changing it to private defeats the platform purpose
- If you want to fundraise privately, use "Investors Only" tier (premium)

**Decision: Allow ONE pinned pitch at a time**
- Not unlimited pins
- Forces clarity on what you're building NOW
- Can swap the pinned pitch anytime
- Old pitches become regular posts in your feed

---

### **For Investors:**

**Decision: Two Account Modes**

**Public Investor Profile** 🔓
- Profile visible to all users
- Can create content (investment thesis, founder advice, etc.)
- Can comment publicly
- Can be followed
- Appears in "Investors on the platform" directory
- Benefits: Brand building, deal flow, thought leadership

**Private Investor Profile** 🔒
- Profile hidden from browse/search
- Can still view all founder content
- Can DM founders (they see your profile when you message)
- Can save/bookmark privately
- Cannot comment publicly (would reveal presence)
- Cannot be followed
- Does NOT appear in analytics ("X investors viewed")

**Decision: Default = Private for investors**
- Protects their sourcing strategy
- Prevents spam from founders
- They can opt into public later
- Most professional investors prefer stealth mode

**Edge Case: What if private investor comments?**
- System prompts: "Commenting will make your profile visible to this founder. Continue?"
- One-time choice per founder: Reveal yourself or stay anonymous
- If revealed, only THAT founder sees your profile, not everyone

---

## **3. CONTENT STRATEGY & TYPES**

### **Decision: Four Content Categories**

**1. Pitch (Required, Pinned)** 📍
- 30-90 seconds
- One per account (can replace)
- Always pinned to top of profile
- Template/prompts provided:
  - Problem you're solving
  - Your solution
  - What makes it different
  - What you're looking for (feedback/cofounder/funding)

**2. Updates** 📈
- Progress videos (15-60 sec)
- Product demos
- User testimonials
- Metrics/traction
- Unlimited posts
- Examples: "We got our first 100 users!", "New feature demo", "Customer interview"

**3. Asks** 🙋
- Specific questions to community
- 15-30 seconds
- "Should I pivot to B2B?", "Which landing page is better?", "Roast my pricing"
- Higher engagement rate (people love giving advice)

**4. Wins & Losses** 🎯
- Celebrating milestones OR transparent failures
- 30-60 seconds  
- "We just got funded!", "We shipped!", "We're pivoting - here's why", "We're shutting down - lessons learned"
- This category is GOLD for authenticity and learning

**Decision: Builders and Investors can ONLY post "Updates" and "Asks"**
- No pitch videos (they're not building something)
- Updates = investment thesis, founder advice, market insights
- Asks = "Looking for fintech founders", "Who's building in AI?"

---

## **4. FEED ALGORITHM & DISCOVERY**

### **Decision: Multiple Feed Tabs (Not One Combined Feed)**

**Home Feed** (Default)
- Personalized algorithm
- Mix of: people you follow + recommended content
- Weighted by: engagement, recency, your interests
- Shows ALL content types from all user types

**Pitches** 🚀
- ONLY pinned pitch videos
- Pure discovery mode for new ideas
- Filters: Industry, stage, location, "looking for" (cofounder/funding/feedback)
- This is where investors spend most time

**Following** 👥
- Chronological feed of people you follow
- No algorithm
- Never miss updates from founders you care about

**Trending** 🔥
- Most engaging content last 24hrs/7days
- Great for lurkers and new users
- Surfacing breakout ideas

**For You** (Investors Only) 💎
- AI-curated pitches based on:
  - Their stated investment thesis
  - Past engagement (what they liked/saved)
  - Their portfolio (if connected)
  - Investment stage preference

### **Decision: Separate "Investor Mode" Toggle**

Founders can toggle ON "Looking for funding"
- This surfaces their pitch in investor feeds more
- Adds a 💰 badge on their profile
- Signals they're actively fundraising
- Can specify: stage (pre-seed, seed, etc.), amount raising, industry

**Why this matters:**
- Not all founders want investor attention (maybe just feedback/cofounders)
- Reduces noise for investors (only see serious fundraisers)
- Founders control when they're "market ready"

---

## **5. ENGAGEMENT MECHANICS**

### **Analytics Shown to Founders:**

**On Each Video:**
- Total views
- Likes
- Comments
- Shares
- Saves/bookmarks

**Premium Analytics:** 📊
- **Investor attention:**
  - "X verified investors viewed"
  - Which investors (if public profile OR if they engaged)
  - Average watch time
  - Replay rate
- **Audience breakdown:**
  - Founders vs Builders vs Investors ratio
  - Geographic distribution
  - Industry interests of viewers
  
**Decision: Basic analytics free, detailed analytics paid**
- Free tier: Total views, likes, comments (enough to be engaging)
- Paid tier: Investor-specific data, demographics, engagement depth
- Pricing: $10-15/month for founders actively fundraising

### **For Investors:**

**Their View:**
- Can see all founder analytics on any pitch they watch
- No restrictions (they're the customer here)
- Can filter pitches by traction: "Show me pitches with 500+ views", "10+ investor saves"

**Decision: Investors see EVERYTHING, founders see limited data**
- Power dynamic: Investors are the scarce resource
- Incentivizes founder paid upgrades
- Industry standard (Crunchbase, PitchBook work this way)

---

## **6. INTERACTION OPTIONS**

### **For Everyone:**

**Public Actions:**
- ❤️ Like (public count)
- 💬 Comment (public thread)
- 🔁 Share (within platform + external)
- ➕ Follow user

**Private Actions:**
- 🔖 Save/Bookmark (only you see it)
- 👁️ View (tracked but private)
- 📹 Reply with video (optional, creates thread)

### **Investor-Specific Actions:**

**Decision: "Express Interest" Button**

When investor clicks this on a pitch:
- Sends notification to founder: "An investor is interested! 🎉"
- If investor is public: Shows their profile immediately
- If investor is private: "A verified investor wants to connect. Accept?"
  
**If founder accepts:**
- Unlocks DM thread
- Investor profile revealed (just to this founder)
- Founder can share pitch deck, financials, etc. in DM

**If founder declines/ignores:**
- Nothing happens
- Investor can't see they were declined
- Prevents awkwardness

**Why not direct DM?**
- Prevents investor spam to founders
- Gives founders control
- Creates intentionality (not just mass messaging)
- Respects both parties' time

### **Edge Case: What if investor messages first without "Express Interest"?**

**Decision: Investor messages go to "Requests" folder**
- Like Instagram message requests
- Founder can preview message + investor profile
- Accept or decline
- Accepting unlocks normal DM
- Declining is silent (investor doesn't know)

---

## **7. CONTENT MODERATION & SAFETY**

### **Decision: Four-Layer Moderation System**

**Layer 1: Automated (Pre-Upload)**
- AI scans video for:
  - Explicit content
  - Violence
  - Hate speech
  - Copyright music (flag, don't block - music in pitches is common)
- Blocks upload if violations detected
- User can appeal

**Layer 2: Community Reporting**
- Report button on every video
- Categories: Spam, Scam, Inappropriate, Stolen idea, Harassment
- 3+ reports = automatic review queue

**Layer 3: Manual Review Team**
- Reviews flagged content within 24hrs
- Can: Remove video, warn user, suspend account, ban
- Appeals process

**Layer 4: Investor Protection**
- Special "Report scam fundraise" button (investors only)
- Fast-tracked to manual review
- Prevents platform being used for fraud

### **Edge Case: Someone steals another founder's idea from the platform**

**Decision: This is NOT the platform's legal responsibility**
- Terms of Service clearly states: "Post at your own risk"
- Recommendation in onboarding: "Don't share proprietary tech/IP in detail"
- But provide resources: NDA templates, legal advice links
- Can ban reported copycats, but can't prevent all theft
- Real-world solution: This happens on YouTube, Twitter, everywhere. Not platform's fault.

**Why this decision:**
- Impossible to police
- Would kill the platform (everyone afraid to post)
- Founders should share vision, not patents
- Many investors value execution over idea anyway

---

## **8. DIRECT MESSAGING & OUTREACH**

### **Decision: Tiered Messaging System**

**Founders can message:**
- ✅ Other founders (unlimited, free)
- ✅ Builders (unlimited, free)
- ⚠️ Investors (3 free cold messages/month, then premium)

**Investors can message:**
- ✅ Anyone, unlimited (they're the customer)

**Builders can message:**
- ✅ Founders (unlimited)
- ✅ Other builders (unlimited)
- ✅ Investors (5 free/month)

**Why limit founder→investor messages?**
- Prevents spam
- Encourages quality over quantity
- Investors would leave if flooded
- Premium revenue ($20/mo for unlimited)

**Edge Case: What if conversation was started by investor?**
- That thread is unlimited, both ways
- Only COLD outreach is limited
- Ongoing conversations never count against limits

### **Message Features:**

**Basic (Free):**
- Text
- Image attachments
- Video attachments (max 2min)
- Link sharing

**Premium:**
- Pitch deck upload (PDF, max 10MB)

---

## **12. EDGE CASES & DECISIONS**

### **Edge Case 1: Founder pivots completely**

**Decision: Allow editing pinned pitch**
- Can replace with new pitch video
- Old pitch becomes regular post (auto-posted to feed)
- Caption: "We pivoted! Here was our original idea..."
- Shows journey, transparency builds trust

### **Edge Case 2: Stealth mode startup**

**Decision: Allow private accounts for founders (premium)**
- $29/month (higher than standard premium)
- Profile not discoverable in search/browse
- Can still message specific investors
- Can share unlisted link to pitch
- Use case: Competitive spaces, enterprise sales

### **Edge Case 3: Investor wants to hide which startups they viewed**

**Decision: This is allowed (and default for private investors)**
- Founders can't see which specific private investors viewed
- Only count: "X investors viewed"
- Public investors appear in the list
- Encourages investors to stay on platform (safe sourcing)

### **Edge Case 4: Someone fundraising on platform closes a round**

**Decision: Celebrate it!**
- Prompt founder to post "Funding Announcement" video
- Give them animated badge: "🎉 Funded on [Platform]"
- Feature in newsletter/social
- Case study for marketing
- Possibly small success fee (1-2% of round) - test this carefully

### **Edge Case 5: Hate speech, trolling in comments**

**Decision: Zero tolerance**
- Auto-hide comments with slurs
- Manual review within 1 hour
- First offense: Warning
- Second: 7-day suspension  
- Third: Permanent ban
- Build welcoming community from day 1

### **Edge Case 6: Competitors creating accounts to steal ideas**

**Decision: Can't prevent, but can make it harder**
- New accounts have limited visibility (don't appear in "Trending" for 7 days)
- Require email verification + phone verification for investors
- Encourage founders to share vision, not IP
- Community reporting for suspicious accounts
- In ToS: Acknowledge risk, founder responsibility

### **Edge Case 7: Investor wants founder's contact info without connecting**

**Decision: No.**
- Must go through platform "Express Interest" flow
- Email not shown unless founder chooses to share
- Phone never shown
- Protects founders from harassment
- Keeps engagement on-platform (better for us)

### **Edge Case 8: Founder gets 100 "Express Interest" from investors**

**Decision: Founder's problem (good one!)**
- They can filter by investor quality
- Batch accept/decline
- See investor profiles before accepting
- Premium feature: Auto-accept from certain investor types
- This is a feature, not a bug

### **Edge Case 9: Video quality is terrible (bad lighting, audio)**

**Decision: Allow it, but nudge quality**
- Upload tips shown first time
- AI analyzes and gives quality score pre-upload
- "Your video is dark. Want to retake?" (suggestion, not block)
- Investors can filter by "high quality video only" (premium)
- Authenticity > polish (especially early stage)

### **Edge Case 10: Someone posts every day (spam)**

**Decision: Daily post limit for free accounts**
- Free: 3 posts/day max
- Premium: 10 posts/day max
- Why: Quality > quantity
- Protects feed from spam
- Doesn't hurt legitimate users

### **Edge Case 11: Investor shares founder's private pitch externally**

**Decision: Against ToS, but unenforceable**
- Terms of Service prohibits this
- Watermark on videos: Username + "Posted on [Platform Name]"
- Can ban investor if caught
- But can't prevent screenshots/screen recording
- Founders should assume anything posted can leak
- Disclaimer in onboarding

### **Edge Case 12: Investor wants to invest but wants NDA first**

**Decision: Facilitate, don't enforce**
- Provide NDA templates in resource section
- Can share documents in DM
- Both parties sign outside platform
- We don't verify or enforce legal agreements
- Just a communication tool

### **Edge Case 13: Founder gets funded by investor from platform, never mentions us**

**Decision: Track it anyway**
- Investor can report: "I invested in this founder"
- Founder verification (we reach out)
- Add to our "Success stories"
- No penalty if they don't report
- Incentivize reporting: Feature in newsletter, profile badge

### **Edge Case 14: Builder joins as cofounder, should account change to Founder?**

**Decision: Allow account type switching**
- Simple: "Update account type" in settings
- Can only switch between Founder ↔ Builder
- Cannot switch to Investor (requires re-verification)
- One switch per 30 days (prevents gaming)
- All content remains, just changes context

   - Select notification preferences (daily digest vs real-time)
   - Follow interesting verticals
6. Tutorial: "Use 'For You' tab for curated deal flow"

---

## **14. NOTIFICATION STRATEGY**

### **Decision: Personalized Notification Hierarchy**

**Founders receive notifications for:**

**High Priority (Push + Email):**
- Investor "Express Interest"
- DM from verified investor
- Your pitch is trending
- Milestone reached (100 views, 1K views, etc.)

**Medium Priority (Push only):**
- New comment on your pitch
- Someone followed you
- New DM from founder/builder
- Weekly engagement summary

**Low Priority (In-app only):**
- Likes on content
- New post from someone you follow

**Opt-out available for each category**

### **Investors receive:**

**High Priority:**
- Pitch matching your thesis posted
- Founder you saved posts update
- Direct message from founder

**Medium:**
- Weekly curated digest (top pitches)

**Low:**
- Likes on your content (if posting)

### **Weekly Digest Email (For Everyone):**

---

## **16. TECHNICAL DECISIONS**

### **Video Infrastructure:**

**Decision: Use Cloudflare Stream or Mux**
- Built-in video hosting, encoding, CDN
- Automatic quality optimization
- Analytics included
- Cost: ~$5 per 1000 minutes stored, $1 per 1000 minutes viewed
- Cheaper than building in-house
- Scales automatically

**File Limits:**
- Max video length: 90 seconds (strictly enforced)
- Max file size: 500MB (should be ~50-100MB for 90sec)
- Formats: MP4, MOV, WebM
- Resolution: 1080p max (auto-downscaled for mobile)

### **Mobile-First Decision:**

**Phase 1: Mobile app only (iOS + Android)**
- Core experience is vertical video
- Native feels better than web for this
- Easy to record in-app
- Push notifications work better

**Phase 2: Web version (browse only)**
- Can't upload from web (prevents low-effort content)
- Can browse, comment, message
- Good for investors (desk research)

### **Tech Stack Recommendation:**

**Frontend:**
- React Native (iOS + Android from one codebase)
- Expo for faster development

**Backend:**
- Node.js + Express (or Supabase for speed)
- PostgreSQL (relational data: users, posts, relationships)
- Redis (caching, real-time features)

**Video:**
- Cloudflare Stream or Mux

**Storage:**
- S3 for user uploads (images, docs)

**Auth:**
- Firebase Auth or Clerk

**Payments:**
- Stripe (subscriptions, premium)

**Analytics:**
- Mixpanel (user behavior)
- Custom dashboard for creators

**Hosting:**
- Railway, Render, or AWS

**Cost for MVP: $500-1000/month** once live with users
